# Homophily Within and Across Groups

This repository contains the codebase for the paper "Homophily Within and Across Social Groups" by Abbas K. Rizi, Riccardo Michielan, Clara Stegehuis, and Mikko Kivel√§. The paper presents a framework that integrates both local and global homophily in social networks using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). This approach distinguishes between strong homophily within tightly knit groups and weak homophily spanning broader community interactions, providing deeper insights into network dynamics, percolation thresholds, and their implications for public health and information diffusion.

The code in this repository is used to reproduce the main results of the paper, including modeling homophily with different clique sizes, generating synthetic networks, and analyzing the percolation dynamics influenced by varying levels of homophily.
