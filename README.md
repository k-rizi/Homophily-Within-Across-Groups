# Homophily Within and Across Groups

This repository contains the codebase for the paper "Homophily Within and Across Social Groups" by Abbas K. Rizi, Riccardo Michielan, Clara Stegehuis, and Mikko Kivelä. The paper presents a novel framework that integrates both local and global homophily in social networks using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). This approach distinguishes between strong homophily within tightly knit groups and weak homophily spanning broader community interactions, providing deeper insights into network dynamics, percolation thresholds, and their implications for public health and information diffusion.

The code in this repository is used to reproduce the main results of the paper, including modeling homophily with different clique sizes, generating synthetic networks, and analyzing the percolation dynamics influenced by varying levels of homophily.

## Paper Abstract
Traditional social network analysis often models homophily—the tendency of similar individuals to form connections—using a single parameter, which overlooks finer biases within and across social groups. This work presents an Exponential Random Graph Model that integrates both local and global homophily, distinguishing between strong homophily within tightly knit groups and weak homophily spanning broader community interactions. By explicitly modeling these forms of homophily and deriving their behavior under percolation, the framework provides a powerful tool for studying disease spread, influence dynamics, and innovation diffusion. We demonstrate that the interplay between different levels of homophily leads to nontrivial percolation thresholds, which can either increase or decrease depending on the combination of strong and weak homophilic ties.
