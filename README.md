This repository provides the **essential code** accompanying the paper:

> **K. Rizi, Abbas**, Riccardo Michielan, Clara Stegehuis, and Mikko Kivelä  
> *Homophily Within and Across Groups*  
> *arXiv preprint* [arXiv:2412.07901](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07901) (2024)

The scripts and notebooks here reproduce the main analyses and figures from the paper, including **clique-based homophily calculations**, **multi-scale analysis**, and **percolation simulations** for both real-world and synthetic networks.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Only the **necessary and essential code** is included.  
> The datasets referenced in the paper are **not part of this repository**.  
> They are **publicly available** through the **original research papers** cited in the manuscript.  
> Please download those datasets and place them in the `/data` directory before running the analyses.
